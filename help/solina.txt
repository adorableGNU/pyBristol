    ARP/Solina String Ensemble
    --------------------------

This is an emulation of the ARP Solina String Ensemble. The controls are
reasonably basic, there is a Bass section which can select a pair of waveforms
and a volume, and a strings section that can select 4 waveforms. The two sections
overlap for one octave, the lowest octave on the GUI. There is an envelope with
an attack and release curve plus a global tuning slider.

The emulation includes a flanging chorus under the FX button plus just 10
memories, keeping inline with the simplicity of the original. The memories are
selected with the 10 buttons on the left control panel, memories being saved
with a doubleclick on the orange key. This panel includes the Midi channel up/down
changer plus the options panel selector. The Options panel contains the flanger
parameters plus a detune for the oscillators used to generate the sounds, used
to fatten the output slightly.
