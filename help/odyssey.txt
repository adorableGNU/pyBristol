    ARP ODYSSEY
    -----------

Ring modulation is correct here, it is a multiplier. This deviates from the
original instrument that used an XOR function on the pulsewave outputs of the
two oscillators. The implementation has two models, Mark-I and Mark-II. These
implement different filters as per the original. Although their characteristics
are different it is not suggested they are a particularly close emulation of
the original.
