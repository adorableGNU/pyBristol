    ARP AXXE
    --------

TBD

At the risk of getting flamed, this is potentially the ugliest synth ever made,
although the competition is strong. It was implemented as a build up to the far
more useful ARP 2600 to understand the ARP components and their implementation.

The implementation is a giveaway written during a week long business trip to 
Athens to keep me busy in the hotel. Its design lead on to the Odyssey and that
was the step towards the final big brother, the ARP 2600.
