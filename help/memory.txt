TBD.

This is actually a lot warmer than the Mini emulator, largely due to being
later code. The mini should be revisited but I am saving that pleasure for when
some more filters are available. [This was done during the 0.20 stream using the
Houvilainen filters and bandwidth limited oscillators to produce a far richer
sound. Also incorporate a number of fixes to the emulation stages.].
