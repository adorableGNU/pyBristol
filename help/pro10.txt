    Sequential Circuits Prophet-10
    ------------------------------

The prophet 10 was the troublesome brother of the Pro-5. It is almost two
Prophet-5 in one box, two keyboards and a layering capability. Early models
were not big sellers, they were temperamental and liable to be temperature 
sensitive due to the amount of electronics hidden away inside. The original
layering and 'unison' allowed the original to function as two independent
synths, a pair of layered synths (both keyboards then played the same sound),
as a monophonic synth in 'unison' mode on one keybaord with a second polyphonic
unit on the other, or even all 10 voices on a single keyed note for a humongous
20 oscillator monophonic monster.

Phil Collins used this synth, and plenty of others who might not admit to it.

The emulator uses the same memories as the Prophet-5, shares the same algorithm,
but starts two synths. Each of the two synths can be seen by selecting the U/D
(Up/Down) button in the programmer section. Each of the two synthesisers loads
one of the Pro-5 memories.

There was an added parameter - the Pan or balance of the selected layer, used
to build stereo synths. The lower control panel was extended to select the
playing modes:

    Dual: Two independent keyboards
    Poly: Play note from each layer alternatively
    Layer: Play each layer simultaneously.

In Poly and Layer mode, each keyboard plays the same sounds.

    Mods: Select which of the Mod and Freq wheels control which layers.
