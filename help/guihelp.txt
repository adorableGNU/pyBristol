There is only one reason this GUI exists! The reason is, that I needed a GUI for "Bristol".
The "startBristol-script" is just perfect and easy to use, but not comfortable if you
like to tinker around. And then there is this overbloated monoBristol, that needs - who
would expect that - mono to run.

If you're already used to work with the startBristol-script you will find out how this works
in just seconds. There are some basic values, that you can change by this GUI. Only if one 
value differs from the default one, it will find its way to the command-line. You will always
see what is getting executed. And if you copy the line and execute it in a terminal it will
do exactly the same as inside of pyBristol.

That is basicly the idea of this GUI. In addition you can save your config and you can always
call the special help-file for your current synthesizer. Just take a look at the menu-bar and
you will see how it works.

If you need further assist, you can always call the bristol-manpage.

help-shortcuts:
F1      --  this page
Crtl+M  --  bristol-manpage
Crtl+H  --  help for your current synthesizer
